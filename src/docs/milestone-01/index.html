          In this section, with the id “overview,” provide a brief introduction
          to your project, including its purpose and goals. This section should
          be 100 words in length, excluding HTML tags.

          Under the id “data-requirements,” structure this section to include an
          introduction, four main paragraphs detailing the top types of data
          your application will handle, and a conclusion, making up 300 words in
          total. Title the section with an &lt;h2&gt; tag. Focus on high-level
          data needs rather than specific database designs or records.

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>

        <p>
          Below is the home page that aims to have the users start using our
          website right away. A search bar and a collection of room cards are
          immediately accessible, offering details such as location and
          real-time availability which we find most people would care about when
          booking a room. There is also a location-based sorting feature
          provides a practical benefit, dynamically ordering room options
          according to their distance from the user.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../../../public/images/wireframe-home.png"
          alt="Wireframe 1"
        />
        <p>
          The sign-in page has a simple and straightforward design. There are
          features such as "stay logged in" and "forgot password" which can make
          it more convenient for the users. The registration form focuses on
          collecting the standard data typically required for on-campus room
          reservations. We can store the information in the database and use it
          to autofill future forms, which will save users' time.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../../../public/images/wireframe-register.png"
          alt="Wireframe 2"
        />
        <img
          src="../../../public/images/wireframe-signin.png"
          alt="Wireframe 3"
        />
        <p>
          The reservation form is all about making things quick and easy for the
          users. As soon as the user lands on the page, there will be a big
          'Reserve' button right at the top so the users don't have to scroll
          down and click when their information is already filled out. The
          user's details will be stored in our database, and the form will
          automatically fill in stuff like name, email address, major, etc.
          Autofilling is the main feature of this project and hopefully using
          this, people at UMass, especially those are new, will no longer have
          to look around multiple websites to reserve the room the want.

      <section id="real-world">
        <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
        <p>
          With the id “real-world,” this section, spanning 200 words, should
          elucidate how your application addresses a tangible real-world issue,
          supported by an introduction and conclusion. Use real-world examples
          as inspiration for this narrative, detailing the problem your project
          aims to resolve.

          this project ties into the integrative experience requirements of your
