          With the id “overview,” this section should provide a 150-200 word
          explanation of the web application your team aims to design and
          develop. Use an &lt;h2&gt; tag for the section title. Focus on the
          project's vision, emphasizing the real-world problem it intends to
          solve and its target audience, rather than delving into interface
          details.

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          Below is the home page that aims to have the users start using our
          website right away. A search bar and a collection of room cards are
          immediately accessible, offering details such as location and
          real-time availability which we find most people would care about when
          booking a room. There is also a location-based sorting feature
          provides a practical benefit, dynamically ordering room options
          according to their distance from the user.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/wireframe-home.png" alt="Wireframe 1" />
        <p>
          The sign-in page has a simple and straightforward design. There are
          features such as "stay logged in" and "forgot password" which can make
          it more convenient for the users. The registration form focuses on
          collecting the standard data typically required for on-campus room
          reservations. We can store the information in the database and use it
          to autofill future forms, which will save users' time.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/wireframe-register.png" alt="Wireframe 2" />
        <img src="./images/wireframe-signin.png" alt="Wireframe 3" />
        <p>
          The reservation form is all about making things quick and easy for the
          users. As soon as the user lands on the page, there will be a big
          'Reserve' button right at the top so the users don't have to scroll
          down and click when their information is already filled out. The
          user's details will be stored in our database, and the form will
          automatically fill in stuff like name, email address, major, etc.
          Autofilling is the main feature of this project and hopefully using
          this, people at UMass, especially those are new, will no longer have
          to look around multiple websites to reserve the room the want.

      <section id="real-world">
        <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
        <p>
          Filling the same forms on different websites have been a tedious task
          for everyone. One typical example of this is booking flights, where
          users previously had to visit multiple airline websites and fill out
          the same information repeatedly. Companies such as Expedia or Google
          Flights addressed this hassle by compiling forms into a single
          website, which helps save people's time significantly. Another example
          would be filling out job applications, which follows the same form
          structure for pretty much all jobs. Simplify helps save applicants'
          time by letting the students only fill out their information once and
          automatically fill out the application for them every time they apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, we found navigating different websites to book rooms in
          UMass and input the same information over and over again frustrating.
          This problem has been something a lot of our friends have also
          experienced. We often book rooms to do group study in the UMass and
          the process of finding the website and fill out the same form every
          time is just tedious.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why we decided to build UMass Room Reserve website as a final
          project. By gathering all the forms together and having the users fill
          out only once, the website will save time for students and faculty at
          UMass, much like the flight booking platforms streamlined travel
          arrangements by offering a single point of access for multiple
          airlines.

        <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
        <p>
          This project satisfies the IE requirements as it provides an
          opportunity to directly apply concepts and skills developed throughout
          my coursework and personal experiences to address a real-world
          problem. Working on a software project with a team requires good
          programming practices, which we can use what we learned from CS 220
          such as functional programming using high-order functions, designing
          test cases and APIs, handling errors and utilizing the
          publish/subscriber model for this project. Additionally, we can also
          use sorting algorithms learned in CS 187 to dynamically order rooms
          based on distance from the user, making sure that most relevant
          options are prioritized. The network communication principles
          introduced in CS 230 form the foundation of our client-server
          interactions, which is also necessary for designing the communication
          between front-end and back-end
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, our team aims to deliver an exceptional user experience.
          Principles which Minh learned in PSYCH 100 will guide choices about
          information presentation and navigation to optimize usability.
          Meanwhile, the user-centric design practices emphasized in CS 325
          which Bao took will inform the interface and overall workflow of the
          site. Justin's background in data science will be invaluable for
          designing an effective database structure, and Patrick's expertise in
          backend development will ensure a stable and responsive platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project represents a culmination of our university education and
          personal growth. Communication skills and critical thinking are
          required to ensure a smooth development process even if there might be
          unexpected errors and setbacks. In this project, we will integrate
          what we learned and apply them to a meaningful and interdisciplinary
          challenge solving a real-world problem.
