        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>At the University of Massachusetts Amherst, booking rooms for things like music rehearsals, group studies, and private sessions is a hassle right now. It's confusing and frustrating for users. Our web app solves this problem by putting all room bookings in one easy-to-use platform. Now, the UMass community can reserve spaces with no trouble. This centralized system streamlines the booking process and ensures fair access to campus facilities. It addresses the scattered booking issue, greatly benefiting students, faculty, and staff, and paving the way for a more organized and efficient campus.</p>
        <p>Centralizing room bookings can dramatically improve how campus spaces are used. It cuts down on the time spent managing reservations and reduces conflicts over room allocations. The system makes room availability transparent, so everyone can plan their activities ahead of time more easily. Additional benefits include better utilization of campus resources and more satisfied users overall.</p>

      <section id="application-parts">
        <h2>Application Parts</h2>

        <h4>User Authentication</h4>
        <p>        
          A crucial component of the application is the user authentication
          and authorization system. This ensures that only authorized users 
          can access the appropriate resources and functionalities within 
          the application. The schema includes fields such as <code>user_id</code>, <code>email</code>, 
          <code>password_hash</code>, <code>role</code>, <code>first_name</code>, and <code>last_name</code>, which store user 
          information and credentials. The application will likely have 
          mechanisms for user registration, login, password management, and 
          role-based access control. This component is critical for maintaining 
          data privacy, security, and providing personalized experiences to 
          different user groups.
        </p>

        <h4>Building and Room Management</h4>
        <p>
          Another essential component is the management of buildings and rooms. 
          The schema includes tables for building and room, with fields like 
          <code>name</code>, <code>address</code>, <code>latitude</code>, <code>longitude</code>, <code>room_number</code>, <code>capacity</code>, and 
          <code>description</code>. This component will handle the creation, updating, and 
          deletion of buildings and rooms within the application. It may also 
          encompass functionalities like searching for available rooms based on 
          specific criteria, displaying room details, and potentially integrating 
          with mapping services for location-based features.
        </p>

        <h4>Reservation System</h4>
        <p>
          The reservation system is a crucial component that ties together the 
          user and room management aspects of the application. The reservation 
          table in the schema includes fields like <code>reservation_id</code>, <code>user_id</code>, <code>room_id</code>, 
          <code>start_time</code>, <code>end_time</code>, <code>num_people</code>, and <code>is_using_computer</code>. This component 
          will allow users to browse available rooms, make reservations for 
          specific time slots, specify the number of attendees, and indicate 
          whether they require computer resources. The reservation system may 
          also include features like managing conflicts, sending reminders, and 
          providing a user-friendly interface for viewing and modifying existing 
          reservations.
        </p>

      <section id="data-requirements">
        <h2>Data Requirements</h2>

        <p>At the heart of our room reservation system lies the cautious management of critical data types. 
          Each category of data we collect and process is foundational to delivering a service that is not only efficient and user-friendly but also secure and adaptable to the diverse needs of our user base. 
          From ensuring the security of user accounts through authentication data to facilitating easy and precise room searches with comprehensive room information, our focus on data integrity is paramount. 
          Furthermore, we understand the importance of reservation data in maintaining a conflict-free scheduling environment and leverage user preferences and history to offer a tailored booking experience.
        </p>
        
        <p>The first type of data we handle is <strong>user authentication data</strong>. 
          This includes email addresses and hashed passwords. 
          Authentication data ensures that each user's account is secure and that they can access only the reservations 
          and functionalities appropriate to their role, whether student, faculty, or administrator.
          <em>Students</em> can search for and book rooms for study groups or club meetings, view their upcoming reservations, and modify or cancel their own bookings. 
          <em>Faculty</em> members have the added ability to reserve rooms for classes and academic events, access reservation histories, and override certain booking restrictions based on their needs. 
          <em>Administrators</em> possess the highest level of access, including managing room availability, approving or denying reservation requests that fall outside normal parameters, and modifying 
          user roles to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the reservation process. 
          Different permissions ensure a smooth and efficient operation of the reservation system, tailored to the specific needs and responsibilities of each user group.
        </p>
        
        <p>Next, we manage <strong>room information</strong>. 
          This includes details about each room available for reservation, such as location, capacity, available dates and times, and technical equipment available (like computers and projectors).
          This up-to-date room data allows users to effectively search and find spaces that meet their specific requirements.
          Additionally, users are able to search based on specific attributes like the building in which the room is located 
          or the closest room location, further simplifying the process of identifying the ideal space for their requirements.
          We handle this feature by storing the building data and geographical coordinates for each room in our database.
        </p>
        
        <p>Another crucial type of data is <strong>reservation data</strong>. 
          This includes information about who has booked a room, what room is booked, at what times, and number of people.
          Reservation data is key to preventing double bookings and ensuring that users can plan their activities without conflicts.</p>
        
        <p>We also prioritize <strong>user preferences and history</strong> to facilitate our autofill functionality.
          This data helps streamline the booking process by predicting and filling in reservation forms with information 
          based on past user behavior and saved preferences, significantly reducing the time and effort required to make a booking.
          Initially, our application will autofill reservation forms with previously entered user data. 
          Looking ahead, we plan to augment this feature with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to further refine and personalize the user experience.
        </p>
        
        <p>In conclusion, our application relies on carefully managing and protecting diverse types of data to provide a user-friendly, efficient, and secure room reservation service. 
          By focusing on these data essentials, we aim to enhance the academic and extracurricular life on campus.

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          Below is the home page that aims to have the users start using our
          website right away. A search bar and a collection of room cards are
          immediately accessible, offering details such as location and
          real-time availability which we find most people would care about when
          booking a room. There is also a location-based sorting feature
          provides a practical benefit, dynamically ordering room options
          according to their distance from the user.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/wireframe-home.png" alt="Wireframe 1" />
        <p>
          The sign-in page has a simple and straightforward design. There are
          features such as "stay logged in" and "forgot password" which can make
          it more convenient for the users. The registration form focuses on
          collecting the standard data typically required for on-campus room
          reservations. We can store the information in the database and use it
          to autofill future forms, which will save users' time.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/wireframe-register.png" alt="Wireframe 2" />
        <img src="./images/wireframe-signin.png" alt="Wireframe 3" />
        <p>
          The reservation form is all about making things quick and easy for the
          users. As soon as the user lands on the page, there will be a big
          'Reserve' button right at the top so the users don't have to scroll
          down and click when their information is already filled out. The
          user's details will be stored in our database, and the form will
          automatically fill in stuff like name, email address, major, etc.
          Autofilling is the main feature of this project and hopefully using
          this, people at UMass, especially those are new, will no longer have
          to look around multiple websites to reserve the room the want.

      <section id="real-world">
        <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
        <p>
          Filling the same forms on different websites have been a tedious task
          for everyone. One typical example of this is booking flights, where
          users previously had to visit multiple airline websites and fill out
          the same information repeatedly. Companies such as Expedia or Google
          Flights addressed this hassle by compiling forms into a single
          website, which helps save people's time significantly. Another example
          would be filling out job applications, which follows the same form
          structure for pretty much all jobs. Simplify helps save applicants'
          time by letting the students only fill out their information once and
          automatically fill out the application for them every time they apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, we found navigating different websites to book rooms in
          UMass and input the same information over and over again frustrating.
          This problem has been something a lot of our friends have also
          experienced. We often book rooms to do group study in the UMass and
          the process of finding the website and fill out the same form every
          time is just tedious.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why we decided to build UMass Room Reserve website as a final
          project. By gathering all the forms together and having the users fill
          out only once, the website will save time for students and faculty at
          UMass, much like the flight booking platforms streamlined travel
          arrangements by offering a single point of access for multiple
          airlines.

        <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
        <p>
          This project satisfies the IE requirements as it provides an
          opportunity to directly apply concepts and skills developed throughout
          my coursework and personal experiences to address a real-world
          problem. Working on a software project with a team requires good
          programming practices, which we can use what we learned from CS 220
          such as functional programming using high-order functions, designing
          test cases and APIs, handling errors and utilizing the
          publish/subscriber model for this project. Additionally, we can also
          use sorting algorithms learned in CS 187 to dynamically order rooms
          based on distance from the user, making sure that most relevant
          options are prioritized. The network communication principles
          introduced in CS 230 form the foundation of our client-server
          interactions, which is also necessary for designing the communication
          between front-end and back-end
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, our team aims to deliver an exceptional user experience.
          Principles which Minh learned in PSYCH 100 will guide choices about
          information presentation and navigation to optimize usability.
          Meanwhile, the user-centric design practices emphasized in CS 325
          which Bao took will inform the interface and overall workflow of the
          site. Justin's background in data science will be invaluable for
          designing an effective database structure, and Patrick's expertise in
          backend development will ensure a stable and responsive platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project represents a culmination of our university education and
          personal growth. Communication skills and critical thinking are
          required to ensure a smooth development process even if there might be
          unexpected errors and setbacks. In this project, we will integrate
          what we learned and apply them to a meaningful and interdisciplinary
          challenge solving a real-world problem.
